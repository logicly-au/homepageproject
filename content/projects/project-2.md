## We designed and implemented a rigorous nation-wide trial of a new digital health tool prototype.

### The information challenge
The University of Melbourne wanted to understand the potential value of a digital tool to give patients targeted mental health information and guidance while they sat in a doctor’s waiting room.
Ensuring that the tool reliably delivered appropriate mental health analyses required a rigorous ethics-focussed approach, as well as complex data structures and workflows that would accurately reflect best medical practices.
The context of the challenge also made it essential that the information system was extremely secure.

### Our digital solution
Logicly developed and implemented a Decision Support Tool (DST) which evaluated the participant’s mental health through an online survey using a tablet device.
It was created in close collaboration with study psychologists, as well as the Department of Health’s IT security team.
The tool used complex algorithms to identify the level of support participants should receive, and emailed them a report.
The DST involved filtering participants into random ‘control’ and ‘study’ groups, and delivering corresponding alternative surveys to each set over 18 months.
A secure administrative interface allowed staff with access to manage the information system, monitor progress, and access insights.
It also supported Care Navigators in providing one-on-one help to study participants, including managing appointments and follow-ups, and recording and evaluating notes and outcomes.

### The outcomes
The collaborative approach ensured the value of the information, the highest level of ethical integrity, and compliance with the Australian Government’s Protective Security Policy Framework.
The project was a success, with more than 13,000 respondents across multiple states participating in the DST trial, providing the University’s researchers with large quantities of high quality data and insights.
