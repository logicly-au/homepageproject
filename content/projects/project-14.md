## We created a data management system to process and deliver health results in user-friendly reports.

### The information challenge
A personal health appliances supplier wanted to improve their customer’s experience and differentiate themselves from competitors.
A scalable data solution was needed that could allow members to easily sign-up, enter new information securely, and receive clear and accessible reports back.
Creating a user-friendly information system would increase their offering’s appeal, as well as form a useful marketing and communication tool.

### Our digital solution
Logicly worked with the supplier to understand their customers and the context of the challenge before designing the solution.
We developed a data processing application that could seamlessly:
• Register new user accounts
• Record user data accurately
• Provide a secure login
• Deliver mobile-friendly reports
The solution was considered from end-to-end to ensure a consistent and positive experience for members.

### The outcomes
The mobile-friendly design provides customers with a secure, easy-to-use portal for tracking and understanding their health outcomes.
It’s automated so that the supplier can maintain an accurate database for communication and marketing purposes, free of errors and duplicates.
