## We developed a secure and complex data management system that works for all stakeholders and their needs

### The information challenge
The DoH and the Primary Health Networks (PHN) wanted to track the quality of current mental healthcare services offered by their providers to improve planning and funding for the future.

To achieve this, they wanted to consolidate different health service datasets in a new, secure, more accessible information system called the Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Dataset (PMHC MDS).

#### Requirements for this included:
<div class="project-text-list">
  <ul>
    <li>Full implementation and delivery in a tight, six-month timeframe - ready for the launch of a new government funding model</li>
    <li>Sophisticated, complex data analysis in clear, succinct reports</li>
    <li>An intuitive and easy-to-use interface</li>
    <li>Secure data collection in compliance with the Australian Signals Directorate</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### Our digital solution
Logicly worked closely in stages with stakeholders to meet critical deadlines while safeguarding the integrity of the data solution.

#### Stage 1 involved completion of:
<div class="project-text-list">
  <ul>
    <li>An accessible user-management interface</li>
    <li>Bulk data upload capability</li>
    <li>Data mapping to migrate legacy information</li>
    <li>Stakeholder consensus for consistent data content protocols</li>
  </ul>
</div>

#### Stage 2 involved completion of:
<div class="project-text-list">
  <ul>
    <li>A user-friendly data entry interface</li>
    <li>A suite of customised reports</li>
    <li>An online version of each outcome measure • Third-party developer accessibility</li>
    <li>A data processing pipeline</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### The outcomes
The MDS provides access to insights and comprehensive reporting for in-depth analysis to the DoH.

It’s a stable and feature-rich platform that evolves and improves as new data sources are added and new reports developed.

Logicly is a longtime partner of the DoH, having worked with them on numerous projects for more than 15 years. For this project, Logicly continues to provide and maintain:
