## We developed a flexible data solution for managing public consultation and feedback to support sustainable urban growth in Victoria.

### The information challenge
The Victorian Government’s GAA needed an accurate and efficient public consultation process to draft a robust Urban Growth Boundary review.
It needed to be able to sort and distribute large amounts of diversely formatted data and supporting files to relevant government personnel for analysis and response.
The already-tight timeline required a rigorous, adaptable approach.

### Our digital solution
Midway through development, three other agencies (the Department of Infrastructure, VicRoads and the Department of Transport) were integrated into the system to contribute to the process.
This required Logicly to pivot and reshape the system architecture responsively to support added complexity.
The result was a dynamic information system that would:
• Receive and manage documents from the public in a wide variety of formats
• Allow staff from different agencies to triage, annotate, and manage files easily and transparently • Provide a tracking application for directing a document between relevant staff members and
eventually to supervisors for review and sign-off

### The outcomes
The client’s changing requirements over the course of the project added new dimensions to the challenge.
Logicly’s approach to close stakeholder collaboration and our experience working with complex data management solutions allowed for an agile and effective response.
The resulting public consultation system was delivered within the project timelines, and was used to successfully process more than 2000 responses.
