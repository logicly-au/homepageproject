## We created a network system architecture to provide simple access and sophisticated tools to researchers and members of the public interested in Australia’s rich cultural heritage

### The information challenge
Deakin University wanted to consolidate 30 of Australia’s most significant cultural and creative arts datasets into a National Virtual Laboratory as part of the Australian government’s NeCTAR (National e-Research Collaboration Tools and Resources) program.
Each dataset is uniquely designed and curated, with different structures, information, and access priorities separating their 2 million+ collection of records.
Despite the value that these resources offer, awareness and accessibility was limited. A new information management system was needed to enable easier navigation of the vast collections.
