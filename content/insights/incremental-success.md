While the flurry of media attention may have died down, the lessons from the axed $2.8bn business registers project must not be forgotten. In this article, we’ll explore why a flexible approach that combines iterative and incremental development can be the best way to solve complex information challenges. Learn what can happen when you bite off more than you can chew, and see an example of our pragmatic approach in action. 

## What can happen when you bite off more than you can chew?
The allure of grand achievements can tempt organisations into embarking on highly ambitious projects. These large-scale projects often use a traditional project management style involving a linear, waterfall approach. In this method, the full scope is defined upfront, then tackled in a sequential fashion, with most benefits only emerging at the end. 

This seemingly straightforward strategy can lead to organisations being overly enthusiastic with their deliverables and biting off more than they can chew.

The main pitfalls of a linear design then build methodology include:
<div class="blog-text-list">
<ul>
  <li><strong>Extensive strain on resources:</strong> Large projects can consume significant time, budget and human resources before any return on investment is realised.</li>
<p>
  <li><strong>Increased risks:</strong> Every phase in a linear project builds upon the last, creating a domino effect where early issues can amplify and wreak havoc downstream. If the project is in a rapidly evolving market, changing market conditions or emerging technologies can render it obsolete before it's even finished.</li>
<p>
  <li><strong>Delayed feedback cycle:</strong> Feedback and testing are deferred until late in the process, which can lead to discovering critical flaws when they are more costly and time-consuming to fix.</li>
<p>
  <li><strong>Scope creep and inflexibility:</strong> Without the opportunity for iterative reassessment, projects can suffer from scope creep or stick too rigidly to plans that no longer serve the project's best interests. </li>
</ul>
</div>

Rigid upfront plans without user input until rollout can prevent adapting to valuable feedback, limiting the project's overall value. It can ultimately result in program failure.

## Lessons from the Government’s failed $2.8bn business registers project
The business super-registry would have been the biggest gov-tech project ever. After four years of spiralling costs, it’s been dumped.

Former NSW Government executive Damon Rees conducted an <a href="https://treasury.gov.au/sites/default/files/2023-08/review-modernising-business-registers-program-report-redacted_0.pdf">independent review</a> of the failed project. He found that the project would likely cost up to five times more, an extra $2.3 billion, and would take five more years to deliver major benefits. Here are the lessons he drew from the failed project:
<div class="blog-text-list">
<ol>
  <li><strong>Avoid large transformation projects:</strong> The review highlighted the perils of oversized transformations, particularly in complex government environments. The initial goal to revolutionise business registration in Australia faced unprecedented challenges, ballooning costs and extended timelines. The lesson here is the importance of scaling projects to manageable sizes, especially in settings as intricate as the government sector, where multiple stakeholders and regulatory complexities can significantly hinder progress.</li>
  <p>
  <li><strong>Maintain legacy systems:</strong> A crucial takeaway from the failure is the need to continually invest in and update legacy systems. The registry project faced difficulties partly because it sought to overhaul deeply outdated systems all at once, creating a massive modernisation gap. Regular maintenance and incremental updates can prevent such gaps, ensuring that systems remain functional and modern over time without necessitating drastic, risky overhauls.</li>
<p>
  <li><strong>Plan for small changes that independently add value:</strong> This approach allows for continuous improvement and adaptation, reducing the risks associated with large-scale changes. By focusing on small, manageable updates, projects can remain flexible and responsive to evolving needs and challenges.
<p>
  <li><strong>Start small and scale gradually:</strong> Merging over 30 business registries, each with distinct legislative histories and technologies, was an ambitious goal. The project's dependence on legislative reforms added another layer of risk. It’s better to start small and scale up when critical proof points and learnings have been achieved.</li>
</ol>
</div>

This project's failure reinforces the need for a more flexible, responsive approach to solving complex information challenges.

## Why does the waterfall approach remain so popular?

Despite its limitations, a rigid, linear approach to many projects persists. Here are six reasons why:
<div class="blog-text-list">
<ol>
  <li><strong>Budgeting processes:</strong> Many organisations' budgeting processes are designed with large, clearly defined projects in mind. This setup often makes it challenging to secure funding for initiatives that are more iterative and flexible. The financial planning mechanisms naturally lean towards the waterfall approach due to its predictability and defined structure.</li>
 <p>
  <li><strong>Psychological comfort:</strong> There's a certain comfort in having a detailed plan. The waterfall method, with its step-by-step blueprint, feeds into our innate desire for control and predictability. It's reassuring to see the entire project laid out from start to finish, offering a sense of security and a potential pathway to addressing all problems in one comprehensive effort.</li>
<p>
  <li><strong>Embedded project management practices:</strong> In many industries, traditional project management methodologies are deeply ingrained, supported by certifications and frameworks that emphasise upfront planning and documentation.</li>
<p>
  <li><strong>Unfamiliarity with iterative benefits:</strong> While the advantages of iterative development are gaining recognition, there's still a widespread lack of awareness. Without a clear understanding of these benefits, it's easy to default to the more familiar waterfall method.</li>
 <p>
  <li><strong>Resource constraints:</strong> Organisational resource constraints, along with the challenge of building cohesive teams, can make the shift towards a more adaptable project management approach seem daunting. When resources are tight, the waterfall method's linear and sequential nature can appear to be a simpler option.</li>
<p>
  <li><strong>Complex stakeholder environments:</strong> The waterfall method's straightforward, phase-by-phase progression offers a clear narrative for stakeholders. This simplicity can be appealing when navigating complex stakeholder environments, even if it sacrifices the project's adaptability and potential for innovation.</li>
 </ol>
</div>

 Understanding these reasons helps us see why the waterfall approach is popular in many project management environments. However, as projects become more complex and the pace of change in the tech landscape accelerates, the limitations of sticking to such a rigid framework become increasingly clear. Moving forward, embracing more agile, iterative, and incremental methods is becoming essential for success in today's fast-moving project environments.

Next, we'll explore the advantages of abandoning the waterfall approach and adopting a more flexible, responsive project delivery approach.

## What is iterative and incremental development?
Iterative and incremental development are two strategies for managing and improving projects more effectively. 

### Iterative development: Refine as you go
Iterative development involves growing a project through repeated cycles. In each cycle, a new version is created, reviewed and refined based on feedback. This method ensures ongoing enhancement and fine-tuning, making sure the final result closely aligns with what users need. It’s especially effective in situations where the project:
<div class="blog-text-list">
<ul>
  <li>has an open-ended goal, allowing for feedback-driven refinements</li>
  <li>is complex and filled with uncertainties</li>
  <li>is large and demands high quality and adaptability</li>
  <li>has requirements or objectives that might evolve over time.</li>
</ul>
</div>

### Incremental development: Build step-by-step

Incremental development breaks the project down into smaller, manageable parts, which are developed successively. Each part adds to the project, gradually building up to the complete product. This method ensures that what's been developed is fully functional and tested at every stage, making it easier to track progress and maintain quality. Use this approach when you:
<div class="blog-text-list">
<ul>
  <li>have a specific end goal for the product in mind</li>
  <li>can define your project requirements distinctly</li>
  <li>are incorporating new technologies</li>
  <li>are working on parts of the project that carry significant risks.</li>
</ul>
</div>

## Choosing between iterative and incremental development

At Logicly, we don’t adhere rigidly to either iterative or incremental development, and we don’t necessarily choose between one or the other. 

Our flexible, practical and pragmatic approach selects the right strategy or blend of strategies to best deliver the specific project deliverable. 

Deciding whether to use an iterative or incremental development strategy depends on several key factors:
<div class="blog-text-list">
<ol>
  <li><strong>Project size and complexity:</strong> Iterative development is often suited for larger, more complex projects. It breaks the project into smaller sections, allowing teams to concentrate on specific areas one at a time. This approach can lower the project's overall risk and enhance the final product's quality.</li>
  <p>
  <li><strong>Uncertainty levels:</strong> If a project's requirements are unclear or likely to change, incremental development might be more appropriate. This method enables teams to deliver functional software quickly and adapt or expand its features as requirements evolve.</li>
  <p>
  <li><strong>Available resources and expertise:</strong> When resources or specialised knowledge are limited, opting for an incremental approach can be beneficial. Focusing on distinct project aspects sequentially ensures each part is fully developed and meets quality standards before proceeding.</li>
  <p>
  <li><strong>Speed to market:</strong> Iterative development can often accelerate the delivery of value. By rolling out usable software versions early and refining the product over time, teams can offer value to users and stakeholders more quickly, integrating their feedback into subsequent iterations.</li>
 </ol>
</div>

Considering these elements will help guide the choice between iterative and incremental methods, ensuring the development strategy aligns with the project's needs and goals. We focus on a flexible approach that blends the most appropriate style across our projects for optimal outcomes.

## A pragmatic approach to combining both approaches

By employing both iterative and incremental development, we focus on continuously delivering value, ensuring the project evolves effectively to meet user expectations and needs.

We’ve found formalised approaches can fail or add unnecessary work by trying to force people and organisations into set processes. 

Our flexible approach helps us adapt quickly and efficiently to changes or new requirements.

We define smaller scopes of work and work with clients in a way that suits them rather than adhering to a pre-defined methodology.

## The advantages of using iterative and incremental development

Iterative and incremental development combines two powerful approaches into a comprehensive framework that enhances project outcomes in several crucial ways. Let’s look at ten reasons why this combination works so well for managing complex information projects:
<div class="blog-text-list">
<ol>
  <li><strong>Keeps focus sharp:</strong> By tackling projects in smaller parts or cycles, teams can stay focused on what’s important right now. This helps avoid getting sidetracked by features or tasks that aren’t immediately necessary.</li>
  <p>
  <li><strong>Quickly delivers working systems:</strong> These methods let teams complete and use parts of the project faster. This is good for keeping everyone motivated and showing progress.</li>
  <p>
  <li><strong>Drives innovation:</strong> Having the space to try things out, see how they work and make improvements encourages creative thinking and new solutions.</li>
  <p>
  <li><strong>Keeps you focused:</strong> Having shorter-term goals helps avoid being distracted by all the things you want to achieve over time.</li>
  <p>
  <li><strong>Allows for changes:</strong> As feedback comes in, it's easier to make adjustments. Whether the user needs to shift or new requirements pop up, these approaches make it simpler to adapt without starting over.</li>
  <p>
  <li><strong>Continuous improvement:</strong> With each cycle or part completed, there's a chance to learn and improve. This means the project is always advancing.</li>
  <p>
  <li><strong>Gets feedback early and often:</strong> By showing users what's being built along the way, teams can ensure it’s what’s needed and wanted. This helps make the final product much more likely to hit the mark.</li>
  <p>
  <li><strong>Identifies and fixes risks early:</strong> Catching potential problems early means they can be handled before they become bigger issues. This can save a lot of time and trouble later on.</li>
  <p>
  <li><strong>Saves money and keeps support strong:</strong> Delivering successful project elements early can help keep everyone on board and avoid wasting resources. This is key for saving budget and goodwill for future iterations.</li>
  <p>
  <li><strong>Retains valuable knowledge in the software:</strong> Software has often evolved over time, and the current team may not have a complete view of everything the software does. Iterating retains the knowledge that is encoded into the software.</li>
</ol>
</div>

In short, combining iterative and incremental development makes projects more adaptable, efficient, and aligned with users' needs. It’s a smart way to tackle complex work, keep teams on track, and ensure the best possible final product.

## Logicly’s approach

Our approach to solving complex information challenges incorporates both iterative and incremental design principles:
<div class="blog-text-list">
<ul>
  <li>We document the pain points and determine the minimum viable product to solve the key challenges</li>
  <li>We use a <a href="https://www.logicly.com.au/howwework/">continuous cycle</a> of learning, defining, using and refining to build up the solution over time.</li>
</ul>
</div>

## How we deliver digital transformation incrementally

### Case study: The Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads Online Travel Survey
The Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads (TMR) needed to shift from paper-based to digital surveys to gather vital data more efficiently and accurately. They aimed for a system that was not only more user-friendly but also encouraged higher participation rates.

### Approach and Execution
We adopted an iterative and incremental approach to develop the digital survey system:
<div class="blog-text-list">
<ul>
  <li><strong>Initial phase:</strong> We began by creating a basic online survey prototype, testing it, and gathering initial feedback to guide improvements.</li>
  <p>
  <li><strong>Real-world application:</strong> The survey was then deployed at three university campuses, providing insights for further refinement.</li>
  <p><li><strong>Targeted modifications:</strong> Based on these insights, we adjusted the survey design specifically for household data collection, enhancing its relevance and ease of use.</li>
  <p><li><strong>Administrative interface:</strong> The final phase involved developing a backend system for survey administrators, focusing on ease of data management and participant support.</li>
</ul>
</div>

### Outcomes
This flexible, evolving iterative and incremental development process led to the successful digital transformation of TMR's survey system, exceeding expectations:
<div class="blog-text-list">
<ul>
  <li>The survey is now predominantly online, with ongoing updates improving the user experience.</li>
  <li>The system's intuitive design and mobile/desktop compatibility significantly increased both accuracy and participation rates.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

By breaking down the project into manageable stages and incorporating user feedback at each step, we delivered a solution that effectively meets TMR's needs. This project is a great example of the effectiveness of a pragmatic combination of iterative and incremental approaches to tackle complex information challenges.
