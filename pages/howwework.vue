                <h3>1. Research</h3>

                <p>In order to develop a thoughtful solution to a complex information problem, it’s essential to have a
                  thorough understanding of what the data needs to inform and the best pathway to get there.</p>
                <h4>Understanding</h4>
                <p>To get started, we deep-dive into the contributing factors, working with all the stakeholders to
                  define the problem and it’s complexities.</p>
                <h4>Strategy</h4>
                <p>Our senior team distill the key findings and develop a high-level strategy with a human-centered
                  focus. The deliverables are prioritised into short, medium and long term stages.</p>
                <h4>Clear pathway</h4>
                <p>Working with our clients, we set agreed priorities, timelines, and a clear pathway so everyone is on
                  the same page.</p>

                <h3>2. Design</h3>

                We design with flexibility to make room for refinements and changes down the track. Our collaborative
                process takes into consideration many different design factors.
                User friendly interface designWe design interfaces based on the user experience, making the process
                clear and easy to navigate for non-digital people. Our design process considers different users,
                workflows and business constraints.
                System & database design
                The system is designed to support the technical needs of the interface and the database design is based
                on the information and outcomes required by our clients.

                <h3>3. Build</h3>


                This stage is about building the interface, systems infrastructure and databases. We get constant
                feedback along the way to identify possible ways to add value or innovation to enhance the system.
                Stepped processEarly on we develop mockups for clients to experience the system and identify any
                usability issues and ways to add value.
                Collaboration Our multidisciplinary team work together from start to finish and only launch the
                platform when all team members sign off with their approval. Their combined skills and expertise enables
                dynamic problem solving.
                Project managementLogicly simplifies and streamlines complex projects. We have a proven track record
                delivering on time with clear, efficient and personalised communications.
                Automated software We use software to detect any bugs, test the user experience and maintain the level
                of quality.

                <h3>4. Maintain & Improve</h3>

                Once the digital solution is launched and live, we continue to work with our clients to gain the most
                from their digital system.
                Training toolsWe can provide training guides, videos and user documentation.
                Problem solving
                We respond efficiently to any problems and confidently offer compensation in the unlikely event of a
                major issue.
                System management
                Logicly maintain the highest possible standards of security and care. We have numerous checks and
                safeguards in place, including automated issue-detection software and regularly-audited security
                systems.
                Updating & improvingWe update the software libraries and systems according to best practice but we also
                look for new ways to improve on the user experience, efficiencies and speed.
                Help DeskWe provide personalised support during business hours, 24/7 support in case of emergencies and
                a dedicated help desk for larger projects.
