                      <p class="py-4">Adam has worked in information technology, data management, and software delivery since 1991 while a Psychology student at Melbourne University. For 10 years prior to that it was his hobby. Adam has a diverse set of skills including research methods, programming, database design, internet technologies, and data analysis. He is a national leader in the design, implementation and support of IT systems for minimum data sets. Adam co-founded Logicly (then Strategic Data) in 1996 and is also our CTO and technical lead, managing all the work to keep systems relevant, running, and consistent with their security requirements.
                      When away from work Adam can often be found attending local gigs and music festivals. He has also recently rekindled a childhood obsession with planted aquaria, largely in lieu of the former, thanks to COVID-19.
